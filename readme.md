# Node.js Microservices Concepts

This repository demonstrates various **microservices** concepts in Node.js, focusing on the following areas:

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implementing secure login and user management.
- **API Gateway**: A single entry point for routing requests to microservices.
- **gRPC**: Efficient communication between services using Protocol Buffers.
- **Pub-Sub**: Event-driven architecture with messaging services.

Each folder contains practical examples to help understand and implement microservices with Node.js, improving scalability, security, and communication in distributed systems.
