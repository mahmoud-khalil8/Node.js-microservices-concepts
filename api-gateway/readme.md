Simple API Gateway and Microservices Concepts

This repository contains a collection of fundamental examples related to microservices and API gateway concepts. Each folder demonstrates a specific concept, providing simple implementations to help understand the basics of building and managing microservices.
Folder Structure
1. gatewayPipelines

    Demonstrates how API gateway pipelines can be configured to handle requests and route them efficiently.
    Includes examples of setting up basic request processing pipelines.

2. httpsExample

    Contains an example of configuring HTTPS for a microservice.
    Shows how to set up SSL certificates for secure communication between clients and services.

3. LB-APP

    A sample application that utilizes load balancing to distribute requests across multiple instances of a service.
    Illustrates different strategies to ensure reliability and scalability in a microservices architecture.

4. loadBalancer

    Contains a standalone example of a load balancer for managing traffic distribution.
    Provides a basic implementation to distribute requests across services based on various algorithms.

5. multiAndSingleThread

    Demonstrates the difference between multi-threaded and single-threaded request handling in microservices.
    Useful for understanding performance trade-offs in different threading models.

6. rateLimit

    Provides an implementation of rate limiting to control the number of requests a client can make.
    Useful for protecting services from being overwhelmed by excessive requests.
